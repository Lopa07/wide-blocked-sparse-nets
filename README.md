# wide-sparse-nets

Train `model` with `dataset` in PyTorch:
- `model`:
    - ResNet18
- `dataset`:
    - CIFAR10
    - CIFAR100
    - SVHN
    - MNIST
    - FashionMNIST

## Getting Started
Clone this repo, then install all dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The code was tested with Python 3.6.9.

## Reference
